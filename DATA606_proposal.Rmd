### Data Preparation

```{r setup, echo=TRUE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(psych)

# load data
load("data/WVS_Cross-National_Wave_7_rData_v5_0.rdata")
wvs <- `WVS_Cross-National_Wave_7_v5_0`

# Luckily the data is already tidy, with each row representing one observation,
# a person surveyed. And each column represents a variable. 
# As this includes every question from the survey, there are over 600 columns..
# Let's select only those that we need. 
wvs <- select(wvs, B_COUNTRY_ALPHA, Q46, Q106, Q107, Q108)

# Rename columns to be more useful - each question in the master pdf maps to a
# column in the df
wvs <- setNames(wvs, c("Country", "Happiness", "Individual_Effort",
                       "Govt_Business_Ownership", "Personal_Responsibility"))

# Exclude respondnets who did not respond or did not know any of the relevant questions
wvs <- subset(wvs, Happiness > 0 & 
                Individual_Effort > 0 & 
                Govt_Business_Ownership > 0 & 
                Personal_Responsibility > 0)

# Let's also invert the store of all of the GO scores so that 10 represents the most
# individualistic, like the other two independent variables. I invert the scale by
# using max - VAL + min. Then we swap the name.
wvs$Govt_Business_Ownership <- 10 - wvs$Govt_Business_Ownership + 1
names(wvs)[names(wvs) == "Govt_Business_Ownership"] <- "Private_Business_Ownership"

# Do the same with happiness scores so higher = better

wvs$Happiness <- 4 - wvs$Happiness + 1
```

```{r}
wvs[sample(nrow(wvs),5),]
```

### Research question

**You should phrase your research question in a way that matches up with the scope of inference your dataset allows for.**

*Are countries with*

### Cases

**You should phrase your research question in a way that matches up with the scope of inference your dataset allows for.**

Each case represents a country. There are 64 countries represented in this dataset.

### Data collection

**Describe the method of data collection.**

Data is collected by the World Values Survey. Each participatory nation has a national team responsible for surveying. The minimum sample size is 1200 per nation, with sampling done with different methodology per team. The surveyor will generally perform the data collection with a paper questionnaire at the respondent's place of residence.

A deeper look at the WVS's fieldwork and sampling can be obtained [here](https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSContents.jsp?CMSID=FieldworkSampling&CMSID=FieldworkSampling#:~:text=Survey%20method,(Computer%20Assisted%20Personal%20Interview).){style="color: blue"}.

### Type of study

**What type of study is this (observational/experiment)?**

This is an observational study.

### Data Source

**If you collected the data, state self-collected. If not, provide a citation/link.**

Data is collected by WVS and is available online here: <https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV7.jsp>

For this project, the data archive was downloaded locally as a url to directly access the rdata from was not made available. The local rdat file was loaded then loaded.

### Dependent Variable

**What is the response variable? Is it quantitative or qualitative?**

The response variable is happiness score. It is discrete quantitative. It ranges from 1 (least happy) to 4 (most happy).

### Independent Variable(s)

The independent variables are *Individual_Effort,* 'incentivization of individual effort', *Govt_Business_Ownership,* 'belief in government business ownership', and *Personal_Responsibility,* 'personal responsibility over government responsibility for population'. All are discrete quantitative and range from 1 to 10.

### Relevant summary statistics

**Provide summary statistics for each the variables. Also include appropriate visualizations related to your research question (e.g. scatter plot, boxplots, etc). This step requires the use of R, hence a code chunk is provided below. Insert more code chunks as needed.**

```{r}
summary(wvs$Happiness)
summary(wvs$Individual_Effort)
summary(wvs$Private_Business_Ownership)
summary(wvs$Personal_Responsibility)

hist(wvs$Happiness, main="World Happiness Ratings",xlab="Happiness Rating",breaks=seq(0.5,4.5,by=1))
hist(wvs$Individual_Effort, 
     main="Belief in Individual Effort Incentivization\n over Government-controlled Income Flattening", 
     xlab="Belief in Invidiual Effort", 
     breaks=seq(-0.5,10.5,by=1))

     main="Belief in Private over Public Business Ownership", 
     xlab="Belief in Private Business Ownership", 
     breaks=seq(-0.5,10.5,by=1))

     main="Belief that People should Provide for Themselves More\n than Government Collective Responsibility", 
     xlab="Belief in Personal Responsibility", 
     breaks=seq(-0.5,10.5,by=1))

# Calculate survey respondent's 'individualism' as mean of the three variables
wvs$Individualism <- rowMeans(wvs[,c("Individual_Effort",
                                     "Private_Business_Ownership",
                                     "Personal_Responsibility")])

ggplot(wvs, aes(x=Individualism, y=Happiness)) +
